# Josh Gibby's Robotics Portfolio

Description:
Our robot uses a mechanum drive. We decided on the mechanum drive because its ability to strafe, the wheels on our bot have smaller angled wheels around the circumference of them. This allows them to be able to turn 2 different wheels and have a sidewards force that moves the bot to the side. Our bots purpose it to open bottles so the ability to strafe will be very helpful when lining the robot up to the bottle and also allowing helpful for just moving around. Our robot is goping to have a large arm that grabs the bottle and then aligns it, then a smaller claw will grab the bottle cap and hold it steady, the larger arm will then crank the bottle foward to take the cap off.

On our robot, we succeffuly created the mechanum drive and attached the battery and brain to the drive. Moving forward, we are going to add some claws to grab the bottle and an opener to open the bottle.

The nest part of our robot is going to be the claws for grabbing the bottle, these will eventually be able to hold the bottle and make it possible to open it. After this we will be workng on implementing the bottle openong system.
